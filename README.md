# Advanced Technology Seminar
MRAC 02 Seminar 




## Objectives 
By the end of this seminar, students will have acquired the necessary skills and concepts to be able to: 

* Conceptualize and design a robotic fabrication or assembly system with sensor integration in architecture- and construction-related scenarios
* Use the tools necessary to design and communicate such a system
* Implement it, by setting up and integrating the required sensing, processing, control and manipulation software and hardware to handle “wicked” materials


KEYWORDS:
`Industry 4.0, sensing, scanning, feedback loops, adaptive processes, real-time feedback, ROS, system integration`
